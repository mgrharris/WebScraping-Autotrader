# WebScraping-Autotrader
In this group project, our team scraped data from Autotrader in an attempt to consolidate data from car searches into a MongoDB database. From there, we could use the data to make an informed purchasing decision. 

Our team used our web-scraping tool to scrape data for similar cars in four major U.S. cities, and compared our results to make inferences on the market for buyers in these cities. Using MongoDB, we outputted summary statistics for each search, and identified the seller offering the lowest price for our searched vehicle.
