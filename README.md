# WebScraping-Autotrader
In this group project, our team built a web-scraping program to scrape data from Autotrader.com using Python's BeautifulSoup and Regex. 

Our team used our web-scraping tool to scrape data for similar cars in four major U.S. cities, and compared our results to make inferences on the market for buyers in these cities. Using MongoDB, we outputted summary statistics for each search, and identified the seller offering the lowest price for our searched vehicle.
